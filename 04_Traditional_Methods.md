## 4.1 Choose Traditional IR Algorithms as Baseline Methods

We selected **BM25 (Best Matching 25)** and **DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)** as our retrieval methods, combined with a lightweight reader architecture using **BAAI/bge-reranker-base** for reranking and **Mistral-7B-Instruct** for answer generation. This approach qualifies as "traditional" because it involves **no fine-tuning** of any components.

:::{admonition} Why This Approach Qualifies as "Traditional"
:class: note
This approach is considered "traditional" because it uses **off-the-shelf, pre-trained models without any fine-tuning**:
- **No domain-specific training** (models used as-is from HuggingFace)
- **Zero-shot application** (no parameter updates on HotpotQA data)
- **Standard retrieval pipeline** (retrieve ‚Üí rerank ‚Üí generate)
- **Baseline methodology** (establishes performance floor before deep learning enhancements)
- **No end-to-end optimization** (components work independently without joint training)
:::

### Method Overview

**Core Approach:**
- **BM25 Retrieval**: Sparse retrieval using term frequency statistics for initial candidate selection
- **DPR Vector Search**: Dense passage retrieval using vector similarity (cosine similarity/inner product) for semantic matching
- **BGE Reranking**: Cross-encoder reranker (BAAI/bge-reranker-base) refines top candidates
- **Mistral Generation**: Mistral-7B-Instruct generates final answers from reranked passages

:::{admonition} Vector Search in Our Pipeline
:class: important
**DPR is Vector Search!** Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) implements vector search through:
- **Query Encoding**: Question ‚Üí Dense vector embedding
- **Document Encoding**: Passages ‚Üí Dense vector embeddings  
- **Similarity Search**: Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) / Cosine similarity
- **Top-k Retrieval**: Return most similar vectors (passages) to query vector

This is the same underlying technology as modern vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate).

### Pipeline Logic for HotpotQA Multihop Reasoning

The pipeline design specifically addresses the core challenges of multihop reasoning in HotpotQA:

:::{admonition} Multihop QA Pipeline Requirements
:class: important

**HotpotQA Challenge**: Questions require synthesizing information from multiple Wikipedia passages to arrive at correct answers, often involving bridge entities and comparative reasoning.

**Pipeline Solution**: A 4-stage approach that progressively narrows down information while maintaining reasoning capability:

1. **Efficient Retrieval** (BM25 + DPR): Cast a wide net to find potentially relevant passages from millions of Wikipedia articles
2. **Intelligent Selection** (BGE Reranker): Identify the most promising passages for reasoning
3. **Information Synthesis** (Mistral-7B): Perform actual reasoning and generate answers
4. **Evidence Tracking**: Maintain traceability for supporting fact identification
:::

**Why Each Component is Essential:**

**üîç Sparse Retrieval (BM25) - Entity Matching Foundation**
- **Purpose**: Find passages containing entities mentioned in the question
- **HotpotQA Strength**: Excels at bridge entity questions where specific entities must be found
- **Example**: For "Which magazine was started first, Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?", BM25 ensures passages about both magazines are retrieved
- **Efficiency**: Handles millions of Wikipedia passages with millisecond response time

**üß† Dense Retrieval (DPR) - Semantic Understanding**
- **Purpose**: Capture semantic relationships beyond exact keyword matching
- **HotpotQA Strength**: Finds passages related to question intent even without exact entity overlap
- **Example**: Can find passages about publication dates and founding information even if phrased differently
- **Complementarity**: Works with BM25 to create comprehensive candidate set

**‚ö° Reader/Reranker (BGE) - Intelligent Passage Selection via Cross-Encoder**
- **Purpose**: Identify which passages actually contain information needed for multihop reasoning
- **Cross-Encoder Architecture**: Uses BAAI/bge-reranker-base cross-encoder for joint query-passage attention
- **HotpotQA Strength**: Understands query-passage relevance at a deeper level than simple similarity
- **Example**: Distinguishes between passages that contain the entities vs. passages that contain answerable information about those entities
- **Efficiency**: Reduces 100+ candidates to 10 most promising passages for reasoning

**Cross-Encoder vs Bi-Encoder for Reranking:**

:::{admonition} Cross-Encoder Advantage in Reranking
:class: tip

**Cross-Encoder (BGE Reranker)**:
- **Joint Processing**: Query and passage processed together through shared Transformer layers
- **Full Attention**: Query tokens can attend to all passage tokens and vice versa
- **Superior Accuracy**: More precise relevance scoring due to complete interaction modeling
- **Computational Cost**: Slower inference (each query-passage pair requires separate forward pass)

**Bi-Encoder (DPR Style)**:
- **Separate Processing**: Query and passage encoded independently
- **Limited Interaction**: No cross-attention between query and passage
- **Efficiency**: Fast inference via pre-computed embeddings and dot-product similarity
- **Accuracy Trade-off**: Less precise due to lack of query-passage interaction

**Why Cross-Encoder for Reranking**: After bi-encoder retrieval casts a wide net, cross-encoder reranking provides the accuracy boost needed for final passage selection in multihop reasoning tasks.
:::

**üéØ Language Model (Mistral-7B) - Reasoning and Synthesis**
- **Purpose**: Perform the actual multihop reasoning and answer synthesis
- **HotpotQA Strength**: Can connect information across multiple passages to derive answers
- **No Fine-tuning**: Uses pre-trained instruction-following capabilities to handle complex reasoning
- **Example**: Reads passages about both magazines, compares founding dates, and determines which was "first"

### Concrete Pipeline Example: Bridge Entity Question

**Question**: "What position did the player drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1981 play?"

**Stage 1 - Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + DPR)**:
- **BM25 finds**: Passages containing "Boston Celtics", "1981", "drafted"
- **DPR finds**: Passages about NBA drafts, player positions, basketball terminology
- **Result**: 100+ candidate passages from Wikipedia, including ones about the 1981 NBA Draft

**Stage 2 - BGE Cross-Encoder Reranking**:
- **Cross-Attention Processing**: Each (query, passage) pair processed jointly through Transformer layers
- **Deep Relevance Understanding**: Cross-encoder models query-passage interactions for multihop reasoning potential
- **Identifies**: Most relevant passages likely to contain both draft information AND player position
- **Result**: Top 10 passages, prioritizing those with both draft details and player information based on cross-encoder scores

**Stage 3 - Mistral-7B Reasoning**:
- **Reads**: "Charles Bradley was drafted by Boston Celtics in 1981..." and "Charles Bradley played center..."
- **Connects**: Draft information with position information across passages
- **Synthesizes**: "center" as the final answer

**Stage 4 - Evidence Tracking**:
- **Maintains**: References to supporting passages for evaluation
- **Enables**: Assessment against HotpotQA's Joint EM metric (answer + supporting facts)

:::{note}
**Why This Works Without Fine-tuning**: Each component leverages pre-trained capabilities (BM25 statistics, DPR embeddings, BGE cross-attention, Mistral instruction-following) while the pipeline design handles the multihop reasoning challenge through intelligent information flow rather than learned end-to-end optimization.
:::

**Mathematical Foundations:**

**BM25 Scoring:**

```{math}
\text{BM25}(q,d) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{IDF}(q_i) \times \frac{f(q_i,d) \times (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i,d) + k_1 \times \left(1 - b + b \times \frac{|d|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}
```

**DPR Similarity:**

```{math}
\text{sim}(q,p) = \text{E}_q^T \cdot \text{E}_p
```

Where $E_q$ and $E_p$ are pre-trained dense embeddings for query and passage.

**BGE Cross-Encoder Reranking Score:**

```{math}
\text{score}(q,p) = \text{softmax}(\text{W} \cdot \text{BGE}_{\text{cross-encoder}}([\text{CLS}; q; \text{SEP}; p; \text{SEP}]))
```

Where:
- $[\text{CLS}; q; \text{SEP}; p; \text{SEP}]$ represents the concatenated input sequence
- $\text{BGE}_{\text{cross-encoder}}$ applies full cross-attention between query and passage tokens
- $\text{W}$ is a learned classification head that outputs relevance score
- Cross-attention allows query tokens to directly interact with passage tokens

**Cross-Encoder vs Bi-Encoder Mathematical Comparison:**

**Bi-Encoder (DPR-style)**:
```{math}
\text{score}(q,p) = \text{E}_q^T \cdot \text{E}_p
```

**Cross-Encoder (BGE-style)**:
```{math}
\text{score}(q,p) = f_{\theta}(\text{MultiHeadAttention}(q \oplus p))
```

Where $q \oplus p$ represents joint processing with full cross-attention capabilities.
