## üß† The Multihop Reasoning Challenge

```{admonition} What is Multihop Reasoning?
:class: note
**Multihop reasoning** in question answering refers to the ability to synthesize information from multiple documents or passages to answer complex questions. Unlike single-hop QA where answers can be found in one document, multihop questions require connecting facts from different sources to arrive at the correct answer.
```

Multihop reasoning represents one of the most challenging frontiers in question answering systems, where we tackle complex questions that cannot be answered by simply extracting information from a single document. Instead, these questions require sophisticated reasoning that connects information across multiple sources, performs logical inference, and synthesizes evidence to construct comprehensive answers.

```{admonition} Core Concept Visualization  
:class: tip
**Input**: Complex Question + Multiple Documents ‚Üí **Document Retrieval** ‚Üí **Evidence Selection** ‚Üí **Information Synthesis** ‚Üí **Answer Generation**
```

The core challenge involves developing systems that can identify relevant documents, extract supporting evidence from multiple sources, and combine this information through logical reasoning to generate accurate answers. Unlike single-hop QA systems, multihop reasoning requires sophisticated orchestration of retrieval, evidence selection, and reasoning components working together seamlessly.

Our approach explores medical domain question answering through both foundational and state-of-the-art methodologies, each addressing different aspects of the domain-specific information retrieval challenge:

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} ÔøΩÔøΩ Traditional Sparse Methods
**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **BM25 (Best Matching 25)** serve as established information retrieval baselines, leveraging statistical term weighting to match questions with relevant document passages. These methods excel at exact terminology matching‚Äîcrucial for medical accuracy‚Äîand provide interpretable relevance scores essential for domain applications.

**Traditional Sparse Advantages**: Computational efficiency, transparency in matching decisions, strong performance on specialized terminology, and no training data requirements for immediate deployment across new medical domains.
```

```{tab-item} üß† Learned Sparse Methods
**SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion)** represents the modern evolution of sparse retrieval, using neural networks to learn which terms are important while maintaining the sparse representation paradigm. Unlike traditional methods, SPLADE can expand queries with semantically related terms while preserving interpretability through sparse vectors.

**Learned Sparse Advantages**: Neural term weighting, automatic query expansion, semantic understanding within sparse framework, and interpretable results crucial for medical applications where decision transparency is essential.
```

```{tab-item} ‚ö° Dense Neural Retrieval
**Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)** employs dual-encoder architectures with BERT-based question and passage encoders, creating dense vector representations that capture semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. Dense methods represent questions and passages in continuous vector spaces, enabling semantic matching without explicit term overlap.

**Dense Advantages**: Semantic understanding of medical concepts, robust handling of synonyms and paraphrases, contextual relationship modeling, and adaptation to domain-specific terminology through fine-tuning on specialized medical literature.

### Sparse vs. Dense Paradigms: A Conceptual Comparison

The fundamental distinction between sparse and dense retrieval methods impacts their suitability for medical domain applications:

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} üîç Sparse Retrieval Paradigm
**Core Concept**: Represent documents and queries as sparse vectors where most dimensions are zero, with non-zero values indicating term presence/importance.

**Traditional Sparse (TF-IDF, BM25)**:
- Statistical term weighting based on corpus frequencies
- Exact term matching with no semantic expansion
- Fully interpretable: can see which terms drive relevance

**Learned Sparse (SPLADE)**:
- Neural networks learn optimal term weights and expansions
- Can add semantically related terms to representations
- Maintains interpretability through sparse vectors
- Best of both worlds: semantic understanding + transparency

**Medical Domain Benefits**: Critical terminology preservation, interpretable results for expert validation, computational efficiency for large literature corpora.
```

```{tab-item} üåê Dense Retrieval Paradigm
**Core Concept**: Represent documents and queries as dense vectors where every dimension contains meaningful information, enabling semantic similarity in continuous space.

**Dense Neural (DPR)**:
- BERT-based encoders create rich contextual representations
- Semantic similarity without requiring term overlap
- Can understand complex relationships and paraphrases
- Captures domain knowledge through fine-tuning

**Medical Domain Benefits**: Robust handling of medical synonyms, understanding of complex medical relationships, adaptation to evolving terminology through retraining.

**Medical Domain Challenges**: Black-box nature complicates error analysis, requires large training datasets, computational overhead for real-time applications.
