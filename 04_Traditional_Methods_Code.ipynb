    "## 🎯 SECTION 4: RAG Paper Baseline - Dense Passage Retrieval (2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This implements the EXACT retrieval method from the original RAG paper (Lewis et al., 2020)!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 What is the RAG Paper Baseline?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paper by Lewis et al. (2020) introduced a powerful paradigm: combine neural retrieval with neural generation. The retrieval component uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)** - Bi-encoder architecture with separate encoders for questions and passages\n",
    "- **Pre-trained on Natural Questions (NQ)** - Google's single-hop factoid QA dataset  \n",
    "- **No fine-tuning** - Frozen retriever weights (this is the baseline configuration)\n",
    "- **MIPS (Maximum Inner Product Search)** - Find passages with highest dot product to query vector\n",
    "- **Top-k retrieval** - Return k most similar passages based on vector similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 DPR IS Vector Search!\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense Passage Retrieval is essentially **vector search** - the same underlying technology used in:\n",
    "- OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone/Weaviate/Chroma\n",
    "- LlamaIndex vector stores\n",
    "- LangChain vector retrievers\n",
    "- All modern RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**The architecture:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question → BERT Encoder → 768-dim query vector\n",
    "Passages → BERT Encoder → 768-dim passage vectors  \n",
    "Similarity → Dot product (or cosine) between query and passage vectors\n",
    "Retrieval → Top-k passages with highest similarity scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Task Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original RAG Paper Tasks (where DPR-NQ was trained and evaluated):**\n",
    "- ✅ Natural Questions: \"Who is the president of France?\"\n",
    "- ✅ TriviaQA: \"What year did the Berlin Wall fall?\"  \n",
    "- ✅ WebQuestions: \"When was Barack Obama born?\"\n",
    "- All are **single-hop** questions requiring one document\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Task - HotpotQA (different from training):**\n",
    "- ❓ Multihop reasoning: \"What year was the director of Inception born?\"\n",
    "  - Step 1: Find document about Inception → Learn director is Christopher Nolan\n",
    "  - Step 2: Find document about Christopher Nolan → Find birth year 1970\n",
    "- Requires **two documents** and reasoning across them\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Implement This Baseline?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Foundations**: See how RAG paper's retriever actually works\n",
    "2. **Learn from Failures**: Observe performance on mismatched task domains\n",
    "3. **Appreciate Evolution**: Understand motivations for modern improvements\n",
    "4. **Build Intuition**: Know when domain-specific training matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 What We'll Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "When we test DPR-NQ on HotpotQA multihop questions, we'll measure:\n",
    "- Document Recall@10: Can it find both required documents?\n",
    "- Supporting-Fact F1: Sentence-level retrieval accuracy\n",
    "- Latency: Encoding and search time\n",
    "- Comparison baseline for modern methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments will reveal how task mismatch affects performance. This isn't about DPR being \"bad\" - it's about understanding when and why models struggle on out-of-domain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the RAG paper baseline and run experiments!"

    "## 🔬 SECTION 5: Why RAG Baseline Struggles - Multihop Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've implemented the RAG paper baseline (DPR-NQ), let's analyze **why** it struggles on HotpotQA multihop questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Question: Why Does Strong Performance on NQ Become Poor on HotpotQA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Mismatch in Action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPR model was trained on Natural Questions, where:\n",
    "- Questions are **single-hop**: \"Who won the 2020 NBA championship?\"\n",
    "- Answer requires **ONE document**: Lakers team page\n",
    "- Encoder learns: \"Find the most relevant single document\"\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA requires **multihop reasoning**:\n",
    "- Questions span **two+ documents**: \"What position did the 2020 NBA championship MVP play?\"\n",
    "- Step 1: Find 2020 NBA championship → Lakers  \n",
    "- Step 2: Find Lakers MVP → LeBron James\n",
    "- Step 3: Find LeBron's position → Small Forward\n",
    "- Encoder needs: \"Find MULTIPLE related but different documents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What We'll Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Failure Case Examples**: Show 3-5 questions where DPR-NQ retrieves wrong documents\n",
    "2. **Error Categorization**: Classify types of retrieval failures\n",
    "3. **Retrieval Overlap**: Visualize retrieved docs vs gold docs\n",
    "4. **Patterns**: Identify which question types fail most\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will motivate our move to modern embedders in Section 6!"

    "## 🎯 SECTION 7: Cross-Encoder Reranking - Precision Boost\n",
    "\n",
    "We've improved retrieval by upgrading our embedder (Section 6). Now let's add **reranking** - a second-stage refinement that can improve precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Bi-Encoder vs Cross-Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bi-Encoder (What we've used so far):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question → Encoder A → Query vector [768]\n",
    "Passage → Encoder B → Passage vector [768]\n",
    "Similarity → Dot product of vectors\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ✅ **Fast**: Pre-compute passage vectors, quick dot product\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable**: Can index millions of passages\n",
    "- ❌ **No interaction**: Question and passage never \"see\" each other\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Encoder (For reranking):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Question + Passage] → Joint Encoder → Relevance score [0-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ✅ **Accurate**: Question and passage processed together (full attention)\n",
    "- ✅ **Better relevance**: Direct relevance modeling\n",
    "- ❌ **Slow**: Must process every question-passage pair separately\n",
    "- ❌ **Not scalable**: Can't pre-compute, O(n) complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Two-Stage Retrieval Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine both for best results:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Bi-Encoder (Fast Retrieval)**\n",
    "- Retrieve top-100 candidates from full corpus\n",
    "- Uses BGE/E5 embeddings\n",
    "- Fast, scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Cross-Encoder (Precise Reranking)**\n",
    "- Rerank top-100 → top-10\n",
    "- Uses cross-encoder for accurate scoring\n",
    "- Slow but only on 100 candidates (acceptable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What We'll Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare bi-encoder retrieval with and without reranking:\n",
    "- Document Recall@10: Does reranking improve document selection?\n",
    "- Rank changes: Which passages move up/down?\n",
    "- Latency impact: Cost of reranking stage\n",
    "- Precision@k: Quality of top-k results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `BAAI/bge-reranker-large` - current SOTA reranker:\n",
    "- Trained specifically for reranking\n",
    "- Optimized for question-passage relevance\n",
    "- Compatible with BGE embeddings (but works with any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments will show whether the latency cost is worth the accuracy gain."

    "## ⚡ SECTION 8: Hybrid Search - Best of Both Worlds\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen two retrieval paradigms:\n",
    "- **BM25 (Sparse)**: Keyword matching, exact term overlap\n",
    "- **Dense (Embeddings)**: Semantic similarity, meaning-based\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we **combine both**? This is hybrid search - leveraging complementary strengths!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Hybrid Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "**BM25 Strengths:**\n",
    "- ✅ Exact keyword matching (great for entities, names, dates)\n",
    "- ✅ Fast, interpretable\n",
    "- ✅ Works well on entity-heavy questions\n",
    "- ❌ Misses semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dense Retrieval Strengths:**\n",
    "- ✅ Semantic understanding (handles paraphrases, synonyms)\n",
    "- ✅ Captures meaning beyond exact words\n",
    "- ✅ Better for conceptual questions\n",
    "- ❌ Can miss exact entity matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid = Combine Both!**\n",
    "- Use BM25 for entity recall\n",
    "- Use dense for semantic relevance\n",
    "- Weighted fusion of scores\n",
    "- Potentially best of both worlds!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Hybrid Search Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For each passage, compute a combined score:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "final_score = α × normalized_bm25_score + (1-α) × normalized_dense_score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- α = weight for BM25 (typically 0.2-0.4)\n",
    "- (1-α) = weight for dense (typically 0.6-0.8)\n",
    "- Normalization ensures scores are comparable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve with both methods** separately\n",
    "   - BM25: Get top-100 with BM25 scores\n",
    "   - Dense: Get top-100 with cosine similarity scores\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalize scores** to [0, 1] range\n",
    "   - Min-max normalization\n",
    "   - Makes scores comparable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fuse scores** with weighted combination\n",
    "   - Experiment with different α weights\n",
    "   - Common: α=0.3 (30% BM25, 70% dense)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rerank** with cross-encoder (optional but recommended)\n",
    "   - Apply cross-encoder to top-100 hybrid results\n",
    "   - Final top-10 selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What We'll Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare three approaches on the same questions:\n",
    "1. **BM25 only**: Pure sparse retrieval\n",
    "2. **Dense only**: Pure semantic retrieval  \n",
    "3. **Hybrid**: Weighted combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics:\n",
    "- Document Recall@10 for each approach\n",
    "- Which question types benefit from hybrid?\n",
    "- Score distribution analysis\n",
    "- Best weight combination (α tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments will show whether combining methods provides robustness across different question types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement and measure!"

    "## 📝 Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how traditional methods implement vector search concepts AND the critical importance of matching your retrieval setup to the evaluation benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Critical Learning: Per-Question vs Global Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Bug We Fixed:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ WRONG: Build index from training, search from validation\n",
    "train_passages, train_metadata = extract_passages_from_hotpotqa(train_sample)\n",
    "bm25_global = BM25Okapi(train_passages)\n",
    "# This gives 0% Document Recall because gold docs don't exist!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ CORRECT: Per-question retrieval from each example's contexts\n",
    "for example in validation:\n",
    "    example_passages, metadata = extract_passages_from_example(example)\n",
    "    bm25_local = BM25Okapi(example_passages)\n",
    "    results = bm25_local.search(example['question'])\n",
    "    # Now Document Recall is meaningful!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- HotpotQA provides 10 context paragraphs per question (2 gold + 8 distractors)\n",
    "- The challenge is filtering correct documents from this candidate set\n",
    "- Global retrieval would test \"can you find documents in a corpus?\" (wrong task)\n",
    "- Per-question retrieval tests \"can you identify relevant docs from noisy candidates?\" (correct task)"
