# Evaluation Methods

```{tip}
  - Describe and explain the evaluation metrics you chose for this problem
  - Why did you choose these particular metrics over others
  - Run the evaluation metics on some dummy data to help readers understand what does a good and bad metric looks like
  - Call-out limitations of the evaluation metrics --> ie. scenario in which it might not work well
  - [optional] The evaluation methods can also be moved to a `utils.py` file so that they can be imported easily later
```
